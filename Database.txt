AWS Databases

Databases
	RDS 
	DynamoDB 
	ElasticCache
	RedShift (DW)
	DMS (databse migration service)

Relational Database
	traditional spreadsheet
		database
		tables
		row (workbook)
		fields (data)

ID is number, name text, gender M/F
Releational database (SQL, oracle, mysql, postgress , aurora, mariadb)
Non releational database - Database , (couchdb, mongodb, cloudant, cloudera)
	DynamoDB (keyvalue pair, documents)
	
	Database
		collection	table
		document	row
		key value pari	fields 


NoSQL database - very new and emerging technology, supported by SQL server, 
	Intelligance orclae hypersion, SAP netWeaver , cognos, JasperSoft


OLTP - online transaction processing - transaction process
OLAP - online Analytics Processing (where analyse information - net profile in a region for a product) 

scaleout - OLTP - place new orders, scaling will be hard, Datawarhouse - copy of database OLAP ( different architecture)

ElasticCache - webservice that makes it easy to deploy  , operate and scale an in memory cahce in cloud (memcached, Redis)

DMS = database migratoin service - database migration service, migrate product database on AWS, AWS manaages the migration , DB transfrer, compress, and transfer, migration process gets replicated, 
	DMS - schema migration 
		Oralce to MySQL
		Oralce to Aurora


AWS database summery 
	RDS - OLTP
		SQL , MYsql, postgres, oracle , aurora, mariadb

	RDBMS
		DynamoDB,

	Redshift 
		OLAP
	Elastic Cache
		memcacheD
		RedIS
	DMS



Database Backups
There are two backups for AWS, Automated and Database snapshorts
automated backups allows to recover your DB to any point of time with a retention time (35 days) , daily snapshot with transation logs, Recovery happens like earlis available sanpshot with transaction logs
Automated bnackup is default, equal size of RDS instance, 
backup is defined window, during backup window IO may be suspended (elivated latency) not being utilized
DB snapshots - manually, user initated they stored even after the RDS is gets deleted, 
Restoring backup - manual snapshot/backup with new endponts

encryption encryptoin at REST, with KMS automatic backups

Read replicas - exact copy of the database, failover to different avaialbility zone, very heavy load, change the connectin strings for different EC2 , 
	read replicas to read replicas - scaling up 


read replica - read only from prod DB, primarly read heavy 
   mysql, postgress , 

read replicas - used for scaling not for DR
	must have automatic backup turned on 
	max 5 replica of any DB
	read replica of read replica - asyncronous ( dealy latency)
	each will have DNS end point
	can not hav eread replica  that have multi AZ
	you can create read replica of multi AZ turned on database however
	slected DB , instance action read replica , t2 microo acloud read rep, AZ, 


Dynamo DB VS RDS
	dynamo offers push button scaling you can sclae your DB on fly wihtout any DB time (compare to RDS replica)

	RDS is not easy to have for bigger instance size or to add a read replica


DynamoDB
	how to you scale it
	fast and flexible nosql db for all applicatoin need consistnet , single digit millisecond  supports both document and key value flexible modle for iot, gaming, ad tech, iot, other applications
	stored on SSD
	spared across 3 distinct data centres
	eventual consistancy read
		all copies of data read in a second, repeating short time updated dta
	strongly consistent read
		reflects all writes that recieved successful response prior to read

	
profisioned through cpacity
	write through put is 0.0065 D for 10 nit
	read through put - 0.0065 per hour every 50 unit
	
	25 cent per month/GB


3 GB per day

1 million spread write per day equls (24*60*60) means 11.6 writes per second

dynamo DB write capacity 12 units needed
for read 12 unit read units
with read capacity unit yu are billined in blocks of 50  cpaicty unit you are bluild in block s of 10

write capacity unit - 0.1872
read 0.0374


dynamo DB table
	name 			aclougurunosql
	primary key  		student id

`1 unit or read 1 write 0.66 / month

manage write 
reserved capacity - 1 to 3 year contract
dashboard - table - items id and name
	id   nmae		surname
	101 rushi
	102 Kushbu 		jones
	

filter studuent surname jones

provision capacity - 5*5 - 3.29/month



Redshift
	Dataware house - fast powerful , managed petbyte scale, 0.25 per hour no commitments to $1K per terabye per year less than 10th of other warehousing solutions
	
	OLAP - online analytics processing 
		digital radio product
	
	adding up columns and brigng together
	columns - adding and joining the data together
    
	datbase layer and infralayer

redshift configuration
	single node (160 GB)
	multi node configuraiton 
		leader node(mange client conn and recieveds query)
		compute node (store data and perform queries and computations) upto 128 compute nodes
	
	10 times faster
		storing data by colum rather than rows
		colum based is very easy for large databse
		data stored sequential
		needs fewr IO greatly improving performance
		stores sequential
		doesnt requier indexses and views
		loading data to talbe samples data and selects most app compression scheme
		MPP - massiv parallel processing - multiple nodes as the data grows
		
	pricing
		compute node hours 1 unit per node per hour 
		for 3 nodes 2160 hous (3 node *24 hours*30 days)
		backup 

	security
		encrypted intransit SSL
		at rest AES 256
		Default takes care of KMS
			mange your own keys thorugh HSM
		
	
	Availability
		currently in 1 AZ
		can restroe snapshot to new AZ in event of outtage



ElasticCache
	
	two engine of elastic cache
	
	elastic cache is a web service that makes easy to deploy , oerate, scale in memory cache in cloud
	improve performance from fast manged , in memory cahce, instead of slower disk based database 
	significally improve latency ( social networking, gaming , media , sharing and Q&A protals) or compute intensive recommendation engine
	cachine improves app perofrmance by storing critical pieces of data in memory - that can include resutl of IO intensive database queires of compute intnesive calcuations

	two type of engine
	
	Memcached	
		widely adopted memory cache sys eleastic cahce is compliant with memcached so populatr tool will work with this service
	Redis
		open soucre versoin of Key value store that supports data strucutre sorted and lists , supports master slave replicatin with multi AZ the can be used to remove redundancy

exam
	which service to use for alleviate load elastic cache (redshift - management keep running heary)
	dynamo DB
	for OLAP


Aurora
	database engine by Amazon
	mysql compliant databae RDBMS
	Aurora 5 time better performance 1/10 of other oracle database

	scaling
		10 GB and increment in terms of 10 GB til 64 TB(autoscaling)
		compute till 32 vCPU 0 and 244 GB mem ( auto button without reboot)
		2 copies of database in 3 AZ ( 6 copies of Data)
		lost of 2 data of write , 3 read availability
		self healing - repair automatic
	replica - 2 type of replica
		autora replica
		arora replica (15)
		mysql read replica (5)
		
auroa 
	R3 large - 2 cpu, 15 GB
	multi AZ
	failover - 15 replicas 
	VPC
	pulic accessbile
	cluster identifies - acloudguru-cluster
